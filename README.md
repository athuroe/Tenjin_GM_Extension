# Tenjin_GM_Extension
This is our attempt at a Game Maker extension for integrating Tenjin (https://github.com/tenjin/tenjin-ios-sdk) into your GM project. Unfortunately our Obj-C skills weren't solid enough to take it all the way.

The code includes a full test project with buttons to test the commands. The commands implemented are:
* init
* connect
* send event
* transaction (not working)

Our hope is that someone could help out with the last bits and get the transaction event working.

Any comments, questions please connect at papaquark@gmail.com

Cheers,
PapaQuark
